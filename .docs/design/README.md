# Robin, a design overview
Robin's user experience will contain a small number of views.  We want to minimize UI clutter in order to provide users with exactly what they need to manage their content.

## Marketing Site
A visitor who is not logged in should land on our marketing site.

## Content Collection View
The Content Collection View is where a user will find all of their posted content as well as be offered the ability to post new content, search their content, or filter by active or deleted/archived content.

## Account View
The Account View allows a user to manage their connected social media accounts as well as their account details.

## Login View
The Login View is a gateway view allowing users to login or register.

## Error Views
Error Views offer user feedback if content isn't found or something is wrong (403, 404, 500, etc).
